Update toolkit and/or this installation manager

By default, this will update both the toolkit and manager, if you just want to update on of them, pass `--<toolkit|manager>-only` option to it.

Usage: manager-cli[EXE] update [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -k, --insecure
          Allow insecure connections when download packages from server

      --toolkit-only
          Update toolkit only

      --manager-only
          Update manager only

  -c, --component <COMPONENT>
          Include a list of components (separated by comma) to update, effective only when updating toolkit.
          
          By default, the value of this option will override the list of components to be updated, meaning if you use `--component a,b`, only component a and b will be updated. If you want to keep the default selection, but adding some extra components to update, you need to include a `..` in the value, such as `--component a,b,..`, then not only a and b, but also other components that were selected by default will get updated.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
