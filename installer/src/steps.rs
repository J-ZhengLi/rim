//! When running this application, it will performs the following:
//! 1. Try to load configuration from a dedicated location.
//! 2. Try gathering settings from various source, such as env vars, or file contents.
//! 3.  a. If configuration does not exist:
//!         Guide the user to generate one, with the gathered settings if available.
//!     b. If configuration exists but is different with gathered settings:
//!         Ask user if they want to update.
//!     c. Otherwise continue to next step.
//! 4. Try to load installation information from a dedicated location.
//! 5.  a. If installation toml does not exist or exist but rustup is not installed:
//!         Guide the user through rustup-init configurations and then run it with args.
//!         After that, update this installation toml.
//!     b. If toml exists and rustup is installed:
//!         Try to gather toolchain/tool info by accessing various files,
//!         and SYNC those info into installation.toml.
